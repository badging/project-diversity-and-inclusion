# CHAOSS Project Badging Submission Guidelines

1. Make sure all the [requirements](./requirements.md) are fulfilled before initiating a CHAOSS Project Badging application.
2. Fill out the [CHAOSS Project Badging application form](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ProjectApplication.yaml)
3. Post an issue in your community issue tracking system that signals to your community that a CHAOSS Project Badging application has been made.
4. Communicate with CHAOSS reviewers during the review process and update your application/project based on their feedback.
5. The review ends when either:
    - All required metric checks are satisfied
    - No more feedback can be put into action
   When either of these conditions are met, the moderator assigns the Badge for the project through the review issue.
4. The whole process ends when the Badge is added to the master branch.
